# Avatar To-do Integration
A to-do list application for the AVATAR Project.

## Requires
* Node and NPM
* The Avatar Service (`jetty-avatar-0.2.5` is the most recent version)
    * Requires Java

## Installation instructions
 1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/robbawebba/avatar-todo.git`.
 2. Run npm install to get the dependencies. You may have to install webpack globally: `npm install -g webpack`.
 3. Copy `.env-example` to a new file called `.env`. This will be your personal dev environment settings.
 4. Configure the values in your `.env` file:
    * `API_HOST`: The base URL for the Avatar Service API. The routes should remain the same, but the port is configurable. **The port number should match the port the Avatar Service uses for its Jetty server.**  To change the port inside the Avatar Service, edit the following files of the Avatar Service: `start.bat`/`start.sh`, `src/main/resources/avatar/fuseki.properties`. (Default 8081)
    * `DEV_PORT`: The port used by WebpackDevServer when serving this front-end project. (Default 9090)  

## Execution instructions
  1. Start the dev server with `npm start`.
  2. Navigate to `localhost:9090` (or the value for `DEV_PORT` you configured in your `.env` file).
